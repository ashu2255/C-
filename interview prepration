"MEAN" stands for "MongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js". 
It represents a group of technologies that are popular amongst the developers because they synergize together. 
The term MEAN stack is so popular because of its ability to quickly adapt the prototyping with Node.js.
It allows it to use JavaScript on the frontend and the backend which can save the developers from learning different programming languages separately. 
Additionally, the nature of MongoDB is based on NoSQL, and therefore it allows you to alter the data without having to care about migration.
It is considered quite valuable when you're trying to build an application with clear specifications. 
The developers prefer the MEAN stack because the community of these technologies has a lot of backend support.
It is easier to find answers and hiring the best of the best developers' expert in this domain.

What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a cross-platform and open-source database that is written in C++. It stores data in Binary JSON format consisting of data storage in the form of key-value pairs.
It is also called a NoSQL database because of its document-oriented nature.
A document stored in MongoDB resembles just like the object in OOPS.

MongoDB aspires to be the best database choice for a system where you need to manage large-sized tables with tons of data. Moreover, it is not required to update the entire table because MongoDB includes fields to manage them.
With the help of MongoDB, you can develop an entire application using just one programming language i.e., JavaScript.
